## üìã SYSTEMATIC APPROACH

### Phase 1: Core Application Files ‚úÖ
All main application logic files have comprehensive educational comments.

### Phase 2: UI Component Library (Current)
Adding educational comments to all shadcn/ui components to explain:
- Component composition patterns
- Prop forwarding and ref handling
- Accessibility considerations
- Styling approaches

### Phase 3: Configuration Files
Adding comments to configuration files to explain:
- Build tool configurations
- Development vs production settings
- Dependency management
- Type system configuration

### Phase 4: Documentation Enhancement
Ensuring all markdown files have clear educational value and cross-reference the commented code.

## üéØ EDUCATIONAL GOALS

Each file should include comments that explain:
- **What**: What the code does
- **Why**: Why this approach was chosen
- **How**: How the patterns work
- **When**: When to use similar patterns
- **Examples**: Real-world usage patterns

## üìä PROGRESS METRICS

- **Completed**: 25+ files with comprehensive educational comments
- **In Progress**: ~40 UI components need review and enhancement
- **Remaining**: ~10 configuration and documentation files
- **Coverage**: ~60% of codebase has detailed educational comments
