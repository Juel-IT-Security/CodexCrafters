/**
 * Production Safety Middleware - Conditionally blocks write operations
 * 
 * This middleware demonstrates several important production patterns:
 * 1. Environment-based feature toggling
 * 2. Non-destructive deployment safety
 * 3. Read-only mode implementation
 * 4. Graceful degradation of functionality
 * 
 * How it works:
 * - Checks MUTATIONS_ENABLED environment variable
 * - Allows all read operations (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS) regardless of setting
 * - Blocks write operations (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) unless explicitly enabled
 * - Returns clear error message when mutations are disabled
 * 
 * Deployment strategy:
 * 1. Deploy with MUTATIONS_ENABLED unset (mutations blocked)
 * 2. Verify read functionality works in production
 * 3. Set MUTATIONS_ENABLED=true when admin portal is ready
 * 4. All write operations resume normal functionality
 * 
 * @param req - Express request object containing HTTP method
 * @param res - Express response object for sending responses
 * @param next - Express next function to continue middleware chain
