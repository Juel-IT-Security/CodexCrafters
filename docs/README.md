```

### Key Concepts
- **Type Safety** - TypeScript throughout the stack
- **Schema-First** - Database schema drives frontend types
- **Component Composition** - Reusable UI building blocks
- **Server State** - TanStack Query for API data
- **Validation** - Zod schemas for runtime type checking

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone and Setup**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd agents-md-platform
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Explore the Code**
   - Visit `client/src/components/` for React patterns
   - Check `server/routes.ts` for API design
   - Review `shared/schema.ts` for data modeling

4. **Build Something**
   - Follow Tutorial 1 to create your first component
   - Try the exercises in the Tutorials section
   - Add a new feature using the established patterns
